# Contributing

Thank you for contributing to this project. This document outlines guidelines and standards contributors should follow to ensure consistency across the codebase and project documentation.

## Guidelines

- Follow the project's formatting and coding style defined in `.editorconfig`. If a rule is missing, open an issue proposing the change.
- Write clear, concise commit messages and keep changes focused.
- Run unit tests and linters before submitting a pull request.

## Documentation Language (Mandatory)

- All documentation generated by or for the project (including symbol descriptions, summaries, README additions produced by AI tooling, and user-facing documentation) MUST be written in Bulgarian (bg).
- This includes:
  - One-sentence symbol summaries.
  - Block-level documentation (e.g., short function/class descriptions).
  - Any AI-generated explanations or doc comments inserted into source files.

### Example (required format)

- C++ symbol summary (Bulgarian):
  - `std::string` — Типов псевдоним за `std::basic_string<char>`, който представлява последователност от символи и предоставя функции за работа с низове.

## Pull Requests

- Explain the purpose of your change and reference any related issues.
- Keep pull requests small and focused when possible.
- Ensure new or modified documentation follows the Documentation Language rule above.

## Formatting and Style

- Follow `.editorconfig` for indentation, naming conventions, and whitespace rules. If the repository does not contain an `.editorconfig`, create one that matches team conventions.
- Prefer descriptive identifiers in English for code identifiers; documentation and comments should be in Bulgarian unless otherwise agreed.

## Tests

- Add or update unit tests for behavior changes.
- Ensure tests are deterministic and do not depend on local environment state where possible.

## Contact

If you have questions about these guidelines, open an issue or contact the repository maintainers.

This file encodes the preference that all AI-generated and contributor-facing documentation be produced in Bulgarian; the assistant will apply this preference when generating symbol descriptions and documentation going forward.
